# ai-signal-triage-assistant
A free, custom GPT that converts unstructured operational input into structured, decision-ready triage signals.  Designed for product, support, and business teams to assess signal category, severity, confidence, and recommended next steps, without over-inference or premature escalation.

### Overview

**AI Signal Triage Assistant** is a decision-support system designed to convert unstructured operational input into **structured, decision-ready triage signals**.

It is built to help product, support, and business teams make better judgments when dealing with ambiguous, emotional, or incomplete signals such as:
- support messages
- user feedback
- internal operational notes

The system prioritizes **accuracy, evidence-based reasoning, and explicit uncertainty** over speed or confidence. 

### Problem Statement

Most organizations receive large volumes of unstructured signals, including:

- support tickets
- feedback snippets
- internal notes
- qualitative observations

Common failure modes when handling these signals include:
- over-escalation of weak or emotional input
- premature assumptions about business ris
- lack of clarity around severity and urgency
- inconsistent triage decisions across teams

This project explores how AI can assist with **first-pass triage** without replacing human judgment or introducing unnecessary risk.
